Extended Standard ML Basis Library

This library contains extensions to the Standard ML Basis Library.
Except for the additional structures, signatures, types, and values,
it is backward compatible with the Standard ML Basis Library. However
it is not "compliant" with the Standard ML Basis Library specification,
because the specification prohibits extensions. But in practice, nearly
all code that relies on the Basis Library will operate correctly with
this extended library.

Currently only MLton is supported. Help with porting to other
implementations of Standard ML is welcome.
